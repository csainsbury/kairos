  - Set up Let's Encrypt certificate integration

- **Rate Limiting**: Implemented multi-level rate limiting
  - Added in-memory rate tracking
  - Created IP-based blocking after violation thresholds
  - Implemented admin tools for IP whitelist management
  - Configured sliding window for request tracking

### 3. Data Protection

- **Data Encryption**: Added encryption for sensitive data
  - Implemented encryption at rest for API keys
  - Created secure backup procedures with encrypted backups
  - Implemented secure permissions for sensitive files

- **Data Retention**: Added data lifecycle management
  - Created automatic cleanup for expired data
  - Implemented backup rotation policies

### 4. Authentication and Authorization

- **Admin Authentication**: Created secure admin interface
  - Implemented PBKDF2 password hashing with 100,000 iterations
  - Added brute force protection with login attempt limits
  - Implemented IP-based blocking for failed login attempts
  - Added session timeout with activity tracking

- **Session Security**: Enhanced session management
  - Added CSRF protection for all state-changing operations
  - Implemented secure cookie settings (HTTP-only, Secure, SameSite)
  - Created session expiration after inactivity
  - Added constant-time CSRF token validation

- **Input Validation**: Added comprehensive input sanitization
  - Implemented HTML/SQL injection protection
  - Added MIME type validation for uploads
  - Created validation for all user inputs

### 5. Audit Logging

- **Security Logging**: Enhanced logging for security events
  - Created structured JSON logging in production
  - Added security-specific log streams
  - Implemented context-rich logging for security events
  - Created admin interface for security log review

## Configuration Updates

### Environment Files

Updated `.env.production` with security settings:
```ini
# Security Configuration
SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=True
REMEMBER_COOKIE_SECURE=True
SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY=True
SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE=Strict
SESSION_LIFETIME=1800
WTF_CSRF_TIME_LIMIT=3600

# Rate Limiting
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW=60
RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=30
RATE_LIMIT_BLOCK_THRESHOLD=5

# IP Whitelisting
IP_WHITELIST=127.0.0.1,::1

# Admin Authentication
ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH=...
ADMIN_PASSWORD_SALT=...
```

### Configuration Classes

Enhanced `ProductionConfig` with security settings:
```python
class ProductionConfig(Config):
    # Enhanced security settings for production
    SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True
    REMEMBER_COOKIE_SECURE = True
    SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY = True
    SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE = 'Strict'
    
    # Force HTTPS in production
    PREFERRED_URL_SCHEME = 'https'
    
    # Production rate limiting
    RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS = 30
    
    # Database connection pooling
    SQLALCHEMY_ENGINE_OPTIONS = {
        'pool_size': 10,
        'pool_recycle': 3600,
        'pool_pre_ping': True
    }
    
    # Set secure headers
    SECURE_HEADERS = {
        'Strict-Transport-Security': 'max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload',
        'X-Content-Type-Options': 'nosniff',
        'X-Frame-Options': 'SAMEORIGIN',
        'X-XSS-Protection': '1; mode=block',
        'Referrer-Policy': 'strict-origin-when-cross-origin'
    }
```

## New Files Created

- **Admin Interface**:
  - `/app/admin.py`: Admin authentication and management
  - `/app/templates/admin/login.html`: Admin login page
  - `/app/templates/admin/dashboard.html`: Admin dashboard

- **Security Utilities**:
  - `/scripts/generate_admin_password.py`: Admin password generation utility

- **Documentation**:
  - `/docs/security.md`: Comprehensive security documentation

## Security Enhancements to Existing Files

- **utils.py**: Added encryption, CSRF protection, and rate limiting
- **__init__.py**: Added initialization of security components
- **config.py**: Enhanced with security configuration
- **routes.py**: Enhanced health check with security status
- **nginx/conf.d/kairos.conf**: Updated with security headers and rate limiting

## Testing

The security enhancements included:
- Secure password hash generation
- Environment variable checks
- Rate limit testing
- CSRF protection verification
- Audit logging checks

## Next Steps

While Task a2 has been completed, there are some recommended future enhancements:

1. Implement security scanning with automated tools
2. Add multi-factor authentication for admin access
3. Integrate with security monitoring services
4. Implement database-level encryption for all sensitive fields
5. Add a Web Application Firewall (WAF)

## Conclusion

The security enhancements implemented in Task 12 provide a comprehensive security framework for the kAIros application, addressing key areas:

- API key management and rotation
- Network security with HTTPS and rate limiting
- Data protection with encryption
- Secure authentication and authorization
- Comprehensive audit logging

These measures ensure that kAIros follows security best practices and provides a robust foundation for secure operation in both development and production environments.
