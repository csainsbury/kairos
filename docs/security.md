# kAIros Security Documentation

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the kAIros application to protect sensitive data, prevent unauthorized access, and ensure secure API integrations.

## Overview

The kAIros application implements a comprehensive security approach that covers:

- Environment-based Configuration
- API Key Management and Rotation
- Authentication and Session Security
- Input Validation and Sanitization
- CSRF Protection
- Rate Limiting and IP Blocking
- Secure Communications (HTTPS)
- Data Protection

## Environment Variables and Configuration

All sensitive information is stored in environment variables rather than hard-coded in source code:

- API keys (Google Calendar, Todoist, LLM API)
- Database credentials
- Email credentials
- Admin passwords (hashed with PBKDF2)
- Secret keys for session encryption

Environment files:
- `.env.development` - Development environment settings
- `.env.production` - Production environment settings (secure)

## API Key Management

kAIros implements a secure API key management system through the `SecretsManager` class:

### Features:
- Encryption of API keys using Fernet symmetric encryption
- Secure storage in filesystem with proper permissions
- Automatic key rotation reminder after configurable expiry time
- Admin interface for key rotation
- Fallback to environment variables if encryption system is unavailable

### Key Rotation Process:

1. Keys are stored with creation date and expiry date
2. System periodically checks for keys needing rotation
3. Admin is notified of keys requiring rotation
4. Admin can securely rotate keys through admin interface
5. Old keys are archived with timestamp
6. Access automatically uses new keys

## Authentication and Authorization

### Admin Authentication:
- Password-based authentication with PBKDF2 hashing (100,000 iterations)
- Secure, random salt for each password
- Brute-force protection with login attempt limiting
- IP-based blocking after multiple failed attempts
- Session timeout after 30 minutes of inactivity

### Session Security:
- CSRF protection on all forms and state-changing requests
- Secure session cookies (HTTP-only, Secure, SameSite)
- Session storage encryption
- Short session lifetime with automatic expiry
- Unique session identifiers

## Input Validation and Sanitization

All user inputs are validated and sanitized:

1. Input sanitization for HTML and SQL injection prevention
2. Type checking on all inputs
3. Pattern validation for structured data (emails, IP addresses, etc.)
4. File upload validation with MIME type checking
5. Maximum request and file size limits

## CSRF Protection

Cross-Site Request Forgery protection is implemented through:

- CSRF tokens required for all state-changing operations
- Token validation with constant-time comparison
- Token rotation on authentication events
- SameSite cookie attribute to prevent cross-origin requests
- Custom headers for AJAX requests

## Rate Limiting and IP Blocking

To prevent abuse and DoS attacks:

- In-memory rate limiting based on IP address
- Configurable request window and limit (e.g., 30 requests per minute)
- Automatic blocking after multiple violations
- IP whitelist support for trusted addresses
- Admin interface for IP block management

## Secure Communications

All production traffic is secured with:

- HTTPS only (HTTP redirects to HTTPS)
- TLS 1.2 and 1.3 only (older protocols disabled)
- Strong cipher suite configuration
- HSTS headers to prevent downgrade attacks
- Public key pinning consideration for critical deployments

## Data Protection

Sensitive data is protected through:

- Database encryption for sensitive fields
- Minimal data collection principle
- Automatic data cleanup for outdated information
- Secure backup procedures with encryption
- Limited data retention periods

## Security Headers

The application uses secure HTTP headers:

- `Strict-Transport-Security`: Enforce HTTPS
- `X-Content-Type-Options`: Prevent MIME type sniffing
- `X-Frame-Options`: Prevent clickjacking
- `Content-Security-Policy`: Control resource loading
- `Referrer-Policy`: Control referrer information
- `X-XSS-Protection`: Additional XSS protection

## Production Deployment Security

Additional security measures for production:

- Reduced error detail in responses
- JSON structured logging with security context
- Restricted file permissions
- Container isolation
- Regular security updates
- Rate limiting enforced at both application and NGINX levels

## Security Testing and Verification

Security testing procedures include:

- Periodic manual security review
- Dependency scanning for vulnerabilities
- Input validation testing
- Authentication bypass attempts
- Rate limit verification
- CSRF protection verification
- Session management testing

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please contact:

- Security Team: security@example.com
- Do not disclose security vulnerabilities publicly
- Provide detailed information about the vulnerability
- Allow reasonable time for response and remediation

## Security Maintenance

- Regular dependency updates
- Security patch application
- Quarterly security reviews
- API key rotation every 90 days
- Security log monitoring
